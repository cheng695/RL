            per-feature ``mean`` and ``std`` arrays.
        history_len: Number of history steps expected by the model (H).
        kd: Velocity damping coefficient used during training.
            This value is passed as a constant input feature to the model.
        effort_limit: Maximum absolute joint torque (Nm).  Torques predicted
            by the model are clamped to ``[-effort_limit, effort_limit]``.
        effort_smoothing: Exponential moving-average factor for effort
            (0 = no smoothing, 0 < s < 1 = smooth).  Helps suppress
            high-frequency jitter from the neural network.
